# 1. Rooms

## Create a room

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/rooms \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 124" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"My Room"}'
```

```

## Get a room

# 10. WebRTC

The WebRTC signaling endpoint is used by the browser or client to establish a WebRTC audio connection.

## WebRTC offer

```text
POST /api/rooms/{room_id}/webrtc/offer
```

The request body contains the SDP offer generated by the WebRTC peer:

```json
{
  "type": "offer",
  "sdp": "v=0\r\n..."
}
```

Open the room in a browser:

```text
http://localhost:8000/room/$ROOM_ID
```

> WebRTC signaling is normally handled by the browser or client rather than manually with `curl`.

# 11. Static Web Interface

## Main page

```text

# 11. Embedding

## Get embed code

Returns a ready-to-use iframe snippet for a room.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/rooms/$ROOM_ID/embed
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "embed_url": "/embed/bdf36a19a0a9",
  "iframe": "<iframe src=\"/embed/bdf36a19a0a9\" width=\"320\" height=\"50\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay\"></iframe>"
}
```

## Embed page

A compact, chrome-free player page meant for embedding on third-party sites via `<iframe>`.

```text
http://localhost:8000/embed/$ROOM_ID
```

```html
<iframe src="http://localhost:8000/embed/ROOM_ID" width="320" height="50" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
```

> The `allow="autoplay"` attribute lets the browser autoplay where permitted; otherwise the player shows a click-to-start prompt, same as the regular room page.
